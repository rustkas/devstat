# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

- Preferred contact: create a private Security Advisory on GitHub.
- Alternative contact: email the maintainers listed in the repository.

Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities. Provide a minimal reproduction and affected versions.
